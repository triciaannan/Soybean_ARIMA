## Soybean Price Forecasting Using ARIMA

In this project, I forecast the price of Soybeans using the ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model.

The dataset was imported via API from the [FRED (Federal Reserve Economic Data)](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/) website.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
I began with exploratory data analysis by plotting a line graph to visualize soybean price trends from **1990 to April 2025**.

### Stationarity Testing
Stationarity is a fundamental assumption of the ARIMA model. To assess this, I:
- Plotted the **rolling mean and standard deviation**
- Performed the **Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test**

The results indicated that the original series was **not stationary**.

### Differencing and Log Transformation
To achieve stationarity, I applied:
- **Log transformation** to stabilize the variance
- **First-order differencing** to remove trend and seasonality

### Model Order Selection (p, d, q)
To determine the ARIMA model parameters, I plotted:
- **ACF (Autocorrelation Function)**: helps identify the **MA (q)** component
- **PACF (Partial Autocorrelation Function)**: helps identify the **AR (p)** component

These plots help narrow down the parameter space, although they donâ€™t guarantee optimal values. The ACF shows how each lag is correlated with the current value, while PACF shows the correlation of lags after removing the influence of shorter lags.
